# Guess-The-Word-Challenge
The system is a word-guessing game with Admin and Player users. Players register with secure usernames and passwords. Twenty 5-letter words are stored in the database. Players can guess up to 3 words/day, with 5 attempts each. Letters are color-coded (green, orange, grey). All guesses are saved. Admins can view daily and per-user reports.
